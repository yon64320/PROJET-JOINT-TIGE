# AI Developer Guide - Technical Decision Criteria and Anti-pattern Collection

## Technical Anti-patterns (Red Flag Patterns)

Immediately stop and reconsider design when detecting the following patterns:

### Code Quality Anti-patterns

1. **Writing similar code 3 or more times** - Violates Rule of Three
2. **Multiple responsibilities mixed in a single file** - Violates Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
3. **Defining same content in multiple files** - Violates DRY principle
4. **Making changes without checking dependencies** - Potential for unexpected impacts
5. **Disabling code with comments** - Should use version control
6. **Error suppression** - Hiding problems creates technical debt
7. **Bypassing safety mechanisms (type systems, validation, contracts)** - Circumventing language's correctness guarantees

### Design Anti-patterns

- **"Make it work for now" thinking** - Accumulation of technical debt
- **Patchwork implementation** - Unplanned additions to existing code
- **Optimistic implementation of uncertain technology** - Designing unknown elements assuming "it'll probably work"
- **Symptomatic fixes** - Surface-level fixes that don't solve root causes
- **Unplanned large-scale changes** - Lack of incremental approach

## Fail-Fast Fallback Design Principles

### Core Principle

Make all errors visible and traceable with full context. Prioritize primary code reliability over fallback implementations. Excessive fallback mechanisms mask errors and make debugging difficult.

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Default Approach

- **Propagate all errors explicitly** unless a Design Doc specifies a fallback
- **Make failures explicit**: Errors should be visible and traceable
- **Preserve error context**: Include original error information when re-throwing

#### When Fallbacks Are Acceptable

- **Only with explicit Design Doc approval**: Document why fallback is necessary
- **Business-critical continuity**: When partial functionality is better than none
- **Graceful degradation paths**: Clearly defined degraded service levels

#### Layer Responsibilities

- **Infrastructure Layer**:
  - Always throw errors upward
  - No business logic decisions
  - Provide detailed error context

- **Application Layer**:
  - Make business-driven error handling decisions
  - Implement fallbacks only when specified in requirements
  - Log all fallback activations for monitoring

### Error Masking Detection

**Review Triggers** (require design review):

- Writing 3rd error handler in the same feature
- Multiple error handling blocks in single function/method
- Nested error handling structures
- Error handlers that return default values without logging

**Before Implementing Any Fallback**:

1. Verify Design Doc explicitly defines this fallback
2. Document the business justification
3. Ensure error is logged with full context
4. Add monitoring/alerting for fallback activation

### Implementation Pattern

```
AVOID: Silent fallback that hides errors
    <handle error>:
        return DEFAULT_VALUE  // Error hidden, debugging impossible

PREFERRED: Explicit failure with context
    <handle error>:
        log_error('Operation failed', context, error)
        <propagate error>  // Re-throw exception, return Error, return error tuple
```

**Adaptation**: Use language-appropriate error handling (exceptions, Result types, error tuples, etc.)

## Rule of Three - Criteria for Code Duplication

How to handle duplicate code based on Martin Fowler's "Refactoring":

| Duplication Count | Action                        | Reason                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1st time          | Inline implementation         | Cannot predict future changes |
| 2nd time          | Consider future consolidation | Pattern beginning to emerge   |
| 3rd time          | Implement commonalization     | Pattern established           |

### Criteria for Commonalization

**Cases for Commonalization**

- Business logic duplication
- Complex processing algorithms
- Areas likely requiring bulk changes
- Validation rules

**Cases to Avoid Commonalization**

- Accidental matches (coincidentally same code)
- Possibility of evolving in different directions
- Significant readability decrease from commonalization
- Simple helpers in test code

### Implementation Example

```
// Immediate commonalization on 1st duplication
validateUserEmail(email) { /* ... */ }
validateContactEmail(email) { /* ... */ }

// Commonalize on 3rd occurrence with context parameter
validateEmail(email, context) { /* ... */ }
// context: 'user' | 'contact' | 'admin'
```

**Adaptation**: Use appropriate abstraction for your codebase (functions, classes, modules, configuration)

## Common Failure Patterns and Avoidance Methods

### Pattern 1: Error Fix Chain

**Symptom**: Fixing one error causes new errors
**Cause**: Surface-level fixes without understanding root cause
**Avoidance**: Identify root cause with 5 Whys before fixing

### Pattern 2: Circumventing Correctness Guarantees

**Symptom**: Bypassing safety mechanisms (type systems, validation, contracts)
**Cause**: Impulse to avoid correctness errors
**Avoidance**: Use language-appropriate safety mechanisms (static checking, runtime validation, contracts, assertions)

### Pattern 3: Implementation Without Sufficient Testing

**Symptom**: Many bugs after implementation
**Cause**: Ignoring Red-Green-Refactor process
**Avoidance**: Always start with failing tests

### Pattern 4: Ignoring Technical Uncertainty

**Symptom**: Frequent unexpected errors when introducing new technology
**Cause**: Assuming "it should work according to official documentation" without prior investigation
**Avoidance**:

- Record certainty evaluation at the beginning of task files
  ```
  Certainty: low (Reason: no working examples found for this integration)
  Exploratory implementation: true
  Fallback: use established alternative approach
  ```
- For low certainty cases, create minimal verification code first

### Pattern 5: Insufficient Existing Code Investigation

**Symptom**: Duplicate implementations, architecture inconsistency, integration failures, adopting outdated patterns
**Cause**: Insufficient understanding of existing code before implementation; referencing only nearby files without verifying representativeness
**Avoidance Methods**:

- Before implementation, always search for similar functionality (using domain, responsibility, configuration patterns as keywords)
- Similar functionality found → Use that implementation (do not create new implementation)
- Similar functionality is technical debt → Create ADR improvement proposal before implementation
- No similar functionality exists → Implement new functionality following existing design philosophy
- Record all decisions and rationale in "Existing Codebase Analysis" section of Design Doc
- **Reference representativeness check**: When adopting a pattern or dependency from nearby code, verify it is representative across the repository before adopting — nearby files alone are an insufficient basis

## Debugging Techniques

### 1. Error Analysis Procedure

1. Read error message (first line) accurately
2. Focus on first and last of stack trace
3. Identify first line where your code appears

### 2. 5 Whys - Root Cause Analysis

```
Example:
Symptom: Build error
Why1: Contract definitions don't match → Why2: Interface was updated
Why3: Dependency change → Why4: Package update impact
Why5: Major version upgrade with breaking changes
Root cause: Inappropriate version specification in dependency manifest
```

### 3. Minimal Reproduction Code

To isolate problems, attempt reproduction with minimal code:

- Remove unrelated parts
- Replace external dependencies with mocks
- Create minimal configuration that reproduces problem

### 4. Debug Log Output

```
Pattern: Structured logging with context
{
  context: 'operation-name',
  input: { relevant, input, data },
  state: currentState,
  timestamp: current_time_ISO8601
}

Key elements:
- Operation context (what is being executed)
- Input data (what was received)
- Current state (relevant state variables)
- Timestamp (for correlation)
```

## Quality Assurance Mechanism Awareness

Before executing quality checks, identify what quality mechanisms exist for the change area:

- Primary detection: inspect the change area's file types, project manifest, and configuration to identify applicable quality tools
  - Check CI pipeline definitions for checks that cover the affected paths
  - Check for domain-specific linter or validator configurations (e.g., schema validators, API spec validators, configuration file linters)
  - Check for domain-specific constraints in project configuration (naming rules, length limits, format requirements)
- Supplementary hint: IF task file specifies Quality Assurance Mechanisms → use them as additional hints for which domain-specific checks to look for
- Include discovered domain-specific checks alongside standard quality phases below

## Quality Check Workflow

Universal quality assurance phases applicable to all languages:

### Phase 1: Static Analysis

1. **Code Style Checking**: Verify adherence to style guidelines
2. **Code Formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting
3. **Unused Code Detection**: Identify dead code and unused imports/variables
4. **Static Type Checking**: Verify type correctness (for statically typed languages)
5. **Static Analysis**: Detect potential bugs, security issues, code smells

### Phase 2: Build Verification

1. **Compilation/Build**: Verify code builds successfully (for compiled languages)
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure all dependencies are available and compatible
3. **Resource Validation**: Check configuration files, assets are valid

### Phase 3: Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Run all unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests
3. **Test Coverage**: Measure and verify coverage meets standards
4. **E2E Tests**: Run end-to-end tests

### Phase 4: Final Quality Gate

All checks must pass before proceeding:

- Zero static analysis errors
- Build succeeds
- All tests pass
- Coverage meets project-configured threshold

### Quality Check Pattern (Language-Agnostic)

```
Workflow:
1. Format check → 2. Lint/Style → 3. Static analysis →
4. Build/Compile → 5. Unit tests → 6. Coverage check →
7. Integration tests → 8. Final gate

Auto-fix capabilities (when available):
- Format auto-fix
- Lint auto-fix
- Dependency/import organization
- Simple code smell corrections
```

## Situations Requiring Technical Decisions

### Timing of Abstraction

- Extract patterns after writing concrete implementation 3 times
- Be conscious of YAGNI, implement only currently needed features
- Prioritize current simplicity over future extensibility

### Performance vs Readability

- Prioritize readability unless profiling identifies a measurable bottleneck (e.g., response time exceeding SLA, memory exceeding allocation)
- Measure before optimizing
- Document reason with comments when optimizing

### Granularity of Contracts and Interfaces

- Overly detailed contracts reduce maintainability
- Design interfaces where each method maps to a single domain operation and parameter types use domain vocabulary
- Use abstraction mechanisms to reduce duplication

## Implementation Completeness Assurance

### Impact Analysis: Mandatory 3-Stage Process

Complete these stages sequentially before any implementation:

**1. Discovery** - Identify all affected code:

- Implementation references (imports, calls, instantiations)
- Interface dependencies (contracts, types, data structures)
- Test coverage
- Configuration (build configs, env settings, feature flags)
- Documentation (comments, docs, diagrams)

**2. Understanding** - Analyze each discovered location:

- Role and purpose in the system
- Dependency direction (consumer or provider)
- Data flow (origin → transformations → destination)
- Coupling strength

**3. Identification** - Produce structured report:

```
## Impact Analysis
### Direct Impact
- [Unit]: [Reason and modification needed]

### Indirect Impact
- [System]: [Integration path → reason]

### Data Flow
[Source] → [Transformation] → [Consumer]

### Risk Assessment
- High: [Complex dependencies, fragile areas]
- Medium: [Moderate coupling, test gaps]
- Low: [Isolated, well-tested areas]

### Implementation Order
1. [Start with lowest risk or deepest dependency]
2. [...]
```

**Critical**: Do not implement until all 3 stages are documented

### Unused Code Deletion

When unused code is detected:

- Will it be used in this work? Yes → Implement now | No → Delete now (Git preserves)
- Applies to: Code, tests, docs, configs, assets

### Existing Code Modification

```
In use? No → Delete
       Yes → Working? No → Delete + Reimplement
                     Yes → Fix/Extend
```

**Principle**: Prefer clean implementation over patching broken code
