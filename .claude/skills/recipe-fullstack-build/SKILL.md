## Orchestrator Definition

**Core Identity**: "I am an orchestrator." (see subagents-orchestration-guide skill)

## Required Reference

**MANDATORY**: Read `references/monorepo-flow.md` from subagents-orchestration-guide skill BEFORE proceeding. Follow the Extended Task Cycle and Agent Routing defined there.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Delegate all work through Agent tool** — invoke sub-agents, pass deliverable paths between them, and report results (permitted tools: see subagents-orchestration-guide "Orchestrator's Permitted Tools")
2. **Route agents by task filename pattern** (see monorepo-flow.md reference):
   - `*-backend-task-*` → task-executor + quality-fixer
   - `*-frontend-task-*` → task-executor-frontend + quality-fixer-frontend
3. **Follow the 4-step task cycle exactly**: executor → escalation check → quality-fixer → commit
4. **Enter autonomous mode** when user provides execution instruction with existing task files — this IS the batch approval
5. **Scope**: Complete when all tasks are committed or escalation occurs

**CRITICAL**: Run layer-appropriate quality-fixer(s) before every commit.

Work plan: $ARGUMENTS

## Pre-execution Prerequisites

### Task File Existence Check

```bash
# Check work plans
! ls -la docs/plans/*.md | grep -v template | tail -5

# Check task files
! ls docs/plans/tasks/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No task files found"
```

### Task Generation Decision Flow

Analyze task file existence state and determine the action required:

| State                              | Criteria                                            | Next Action                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tasks exist                        | .md files in tasks/ directory                       | User's execution instruction serves as batch approval → Enter autonomous execution immediately |
| No tasks + plan exists             | Plan exists but no task files                       | Confirm with user → run task-decomposer                                                        |
| Neither exists + Design Doc exists | No plan or task files, but docs/design/\*.md exists | Invoke work-planner to create work plan from Design Doc(s), then proceed to task decomposition |
| Neither exists                     | No plan, no task files, no Design Doc               | Report missing prerequisites to user and stop                                                  |

## Task Decomposition Phase (Conditional)

When task files don't exist:

### 1. User Confirmation

```
No task files found.
Work plan: docs/plans/[plan-name].md

Generate tasks from the work plan? (y/n):
```

### 2. Task Decomposition (if approved)

Invoke task-decomposer using Agent tool:

- `subagent_type`: "dev-workflows:task-decomposer"
- `description`: "Decompose work plan"
- `prompt`: "Read work plan at docs/plans/[plan-name].md and decompose into atomic tasks. Output: Individual task files in docs/plans/tasks/. Granularity: 1 task = 1 commit = independently executable. Use layer-aware naming: {plan}-backend-task-{n}.md, {plan}-frontend-task-{n}.md based on Target files paths."

### 3. Verify Generation

```bash
# Verify generated task files
! ls -la docs/plans/tasks/*.md | head -10
```

## Pre-execution Checklist

- [ ] Confirmed task files exist in docs/plans/tasks/
- [ ] Identified task execution order (dependencies)
- [ ] **Environment check**: Can I execute per-task commit cycle?
  - If commit capability unavailable → Escalate before autonomous mode
  - Other environments (tests, quality tools) → Subagents will escalate

## Task Execution Cycle (Filename-Pattern-Based)

**MANDATORY**: Route agents by task filename pattern from monorepo-flow.md reference.

### Agent Routing Table

| Filename Pattern             | Executor                                      | Quality Fixer                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `*-backend-task-*`           | dev-workflows:task-executor                   | dev-workflows:quality-fixer                   |
| `*-frontend-task-*`          | dev-workflows-frontend:task-executor-frontend | dev-workflows-frontend:quality-fixer-frontend |
| `*-task-*` (no layer prefix) | dev-workflows:task-executor                   | dev-workflows:quality-fixer (default)         |

### Task Execution (4-Step Cycle)

For EACH task, YOU MUST:

1. **Register tasks using TaskCreate**: Register work steps. Always include: first "Confirm skill constraints", final "Verify skill fidelity"
2. **Agent tool** (subagent_type per routing table) → Pass task file path in prompt, receive structured response
3. **CHECK executor response**:
   - `status: "escalation_needed"` or `"blocked"` → STOP and escalate to user
   - `requiresTestReview` is `true` → Execute **integration-test-reviewer**
     - `needs_revision` → Return to step 2 with `requiredFixes`
     - `approved` → Proceed to step 4
   - `readyForQualityCheck: true` → Proceed to step 4
4. **INVOKE quality-fixer**: Execute all quality checks and fixes (layer-appropriate per routing table). **Always pass** the current task file path as `task_file`
5. **CHECK quality-fixer response**:
   - `stub_detected` → Return to step 2 with `incompleteImplementations[]` details
   - `blocked` → STOP and escalate to user
   - `approved` → Proceed to step 6
6. **COMMIT on approval**: Execute git commit

**CRITICAL**: Parse every sub-agent response for status fields. Execute the matching branch in the 4-step cycle. Proceed to next task only after layer-appropriate quality-fixer returns `approved`.

## Sub-agent Invocation Constraints

**MANDATORY suffix for ALL sub-agent prompts**:

```
[SYSTEM CONSTRAINT]
This agent operates within build skill scope. Use orchestrator-provided rules only.
```

Autonomous sub-agents require scope constraints for stable execution. ALWAYS append this constraint to every sub-agent prompt.

Verify task files exist per Pre-execution Checklist, then enter autonomous execution mode. When requirement changes are detected during execution, escalate to the user with the change summary before continuing.

## Post-Implementation Verification (After All Tasks Complete)

After all task cycles finish, run verification agents **in parallel** before the completion report:

1. **Invoke both in parallel** using Agent tool:
   - code-verifier (subagent_type: "dev-workflows:code-verifier") → invoke **once per Design Doc** (`doc_type: design-doc`, single `document_path`, `code_paths`: implementation file list from `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`)
   - security-reviewer (subagent_type: "dev-workflows:security-reviewer") → Design Doc path(s), implementation file list

2. **Consolidate results** — check pass/fail for each:
   - code-verifier: **pass** when `status` is `consistent` or `mostly_consistent`. **fail** when `needs_review` or `inconsistent`. Collect `discrepancies` with status `drift`, `conflict`, or `gap`
   - security-reviewer: **pass** when `status` is `approved` or `approved_with_notes`. **fail** when `needs_revision`. **blocked** → Escalate to user
   - Present unified verification report to user

3. **Fix cycle** (when any verifier failed):
   - Consolidate all actionable findings into a single task file
   - Execute layer-appropriate task-executor with consolidated fixes → quality-fixer
   - Re-run only the failed verifiers (by the criteria in step 2)
   - Repeat until all pass or `blocked` → Escalate to user

4. **All passed** → Proceed to completion report

## Output Example
