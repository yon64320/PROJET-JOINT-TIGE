title: Co-locate Schemas with Their Boundary Layer
impact: HIGH
description: Place schemas next to the boundary that uses them. API schemas in api/users/schemas.ts, form schemas in features/profile/form-schema.ts. Domain types use z.infer, never re-export raw schemas across layers.

# Co-locate Schemas with Their Boundary Layer

## Problem

Dumping all schemas into a single `schemas/` folder creates a grab bag of unrelated schemas with no indication of where they're used. Schemas for API routes, form validation, and env parsing all mix together, making it unclear which boundary owns which schema.

## Incorrect

```
// BUG: everything in one folder — no layering, unclear ownership
src/
  schemas/
    user.ts          // used by API AND form AND env?
    order.ts
    config.ts
    form-profile.ts
    api-response.ts
    db-result.ts
```

```typescript
// BUG: domain module imports and re-exports raw schemas
// src/domain/user.ts
import { UserSchema } from "../schemas/user";
export { UserSchema }; // leaking parsing into domain
```

## Correct

```
src/
  api/
    users/
      route.ts
      schemas.ts       // API request/response schemas for /users
    orders/
      route.ts
      schemas.ts       // API schemas for /orders
  features/
    profile/
      form-schema.ts   // form validation schema
      ProfileForm.tsx
  config/
    env.ts             // env var schema, parsed at startup
  domain/
    types.ts           // z.infer types only — no raw schemas
```

```typescript
// api/users/schemas.ts — co-located with the route
import { z } from "zod";

export const CreateUserBody = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.email(),
});

export const UserResponse = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.email(),
});

// domain/types.ts — inferred types only, no raw schemas
import type { CreateUserBody, UserResponse } from "../api/users/schemas";
import type { z } from "zod";

export type CreateUser = z.infer<typeof CreateUserBody>;
export type User = z.infer<typeof UserResponse>;
```

## Why

Co-location makes ownership clear: the API route handler and its schemas live in the same directory. When a route changes, the schema changes with it. Domain types are derived via `z.infer` so the domain layer never depends on Zod directly — only on TypeScript types. This keeps parsing at the boundary and business logic free of validation concerns.
