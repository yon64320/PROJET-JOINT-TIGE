| Type     | Path               | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Existing | src/[actual-path]  | [Current implementation] |
| New      | src/[planned-path] | [Planned new creation]   |

### Integration Points (Include even for new implementations)

- **Integration Target**: [What to connect with]

- **Log levels**: [Which events at DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR]
- **Sensitive data**: [Fields to mask or exclude — coordinate with Security Considerations]
- **Monitoring**: [Metrics to track, alert thresholds, dashboard requirements]

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Approach

**Selected Approach**: [Approach name or combination]
**Selection Reason**: [Reason considering project constraints and technical dependencies]

### Technical Dependencies and Implementation Order

#### Required Implementation Order

1. **[Component/Feature A]**
   - Technical Reason: [Why this needs to be implemented first]
   - Dependent Elements: [Other components that depend on this]

2. **[Component/Feature B]**
   - Technical Reason: [Technical necessity to implement after A]
   - Prerequisites: [Required pre-implementations]

### Migration Strategy

[Technical migration approach, ensuring backward compatibility]

## Security Considerations

Evaluate the following for this feature's trust boundaries and data flow:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: What authentication is required for new entry points? What authorization checks protect resource access?
- **Input Validation**: Where does external input enter the system? How is it validated before processing?
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: What data requires protection (encryption, masking, access control)? What data is safe to include in logs and error responses?

Mark items as N/A with brief rationale when the feature has no relevant trust boundary.

## Test Boundaries

### Mock Boundary Decisions

| Component/Dependency                     | Mock?    | Rationale                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| [External API / DB / File system / etc.] | [Yes/No] | [Why this boundary was chosen] |

### Data Layer Testing Strategy

- **Schema dependencies**: [List tables/models this feature reads from or writes to, with paths to their definitions]
- **Test data approach**: [How test data is provided — fixtures, factories, seed scripts, or real database]
- **Mock limitations acknowledged**: [What cannot be reliably tested with mocks alone for this feature]

Mark as N/A with brief rationale when the feature has no data layer dependencies.

### Integration Verification Points

- [List critical integration points that require testing beyond unit-level mocks]

## Verification Strategy

Verification Strategy defines what correctness means and how to prove it at design time. L1/L2/L3 (from implementation-approach skill) define completion verification granularity at task execution time.

### Correctness Proof Method

How will this change's correctness be demonstrated?

- **Correctness definition**: [What "correct" means for this change — e.g., "output matches existing behavior", "all ACs pass in production-equivalent environment", "generated queries execute without error on target DB"]
- **Verification method**: [Specific technique — e.g., "compare new implementation output against existing implementation", "run against staging DB", "contract test with real API"]
- **Verification timing**: [When verification occurs — e.g., "after first vertical slice", "per repository", "at integration phase"]

### Early Verification Point

What is verified first, and how, to confirm the approach is correct before scaling?

- **First verification target**: [The smallest unit that proves the approach works — e.g., "first repository migration", "single API endpoint", "one screen flow"]
- **Success criteria**: [Observable outcome — e.g., "CSV download produces identical output to legacy", "API returns 200 with expected schema"]
- **Failure response**: [What to do if early verification fails — e.g., "reassess approach before proceeding", "escalate to user"]

### Output Comparison (When Replacing or Modifying Existing Behavior)

How will behavioral equivalence be verified between existing and new implementation?

- **Comparison input**: [Identical input used for both implementations — e.g., "same DB snapshot", "same API request payload"]
- **Expected output fields**: [Specific fields/columns to compare — e.g., "all output columns", "response body fields: id, status, amount"]
- **Diff method**: [How to compare — e.g., "file-level diff", "JSON field-by-field comparison", "row count + spot check"]
- **Transformation pipeline coverage**: [Each step from codebase analysis `dataTransformationPipelines` and what the comparison covers]

Mark as N/A with brief rationale when the design introduces entirely new behavior with no existing equivalent.

## Future Extensibility

- **Extension points**: [Interfaces, hooks, or plugin mechanisms designed for future use]
- **Known future requirements**: [Planned features that influenced current design decisions]
- **Intentional limitations**: [What was deliberately kept simple and why]
