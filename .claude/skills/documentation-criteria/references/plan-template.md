## Quality Assurance Mechanisms (from Design Doc)

Adopted quality gates for the change area. Each task in this plan must satisfy these mechanisms.

| Mechanism           | Enforces                          | Config Location  | Covered Files                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [Tool/check name]   | [What quality aspect it enforces] | [path/to/config] | [file paths or patterns covered, or "project-wide"] |
| [Domain constraint] | [What it enforces]                | [path/to/source] | [file paths or patterns covered, or "project-wide"] |

## Design-to-Plan Traceability

Maps each Design Doc technical requirement to the covering task(s). One row per extracted item. Every row must have at least one covering task, or an explicit gap justification.

| DD Section             | DD Item         | Category                                                                           | Covered By Task(s) | Gap Status | Notes |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| [Section name from DD] | [Specific item] | impl-target / connection-switching / contract-change / verification / prerequisite | [Phase X Task Y]   | covered    |       |

**Category values**: `impl-target` (implementation target), `connection-switching` (connection/switching/registration), `contract-change` (contract change and propagation), `verification` (verification requirement), `prerequisite` (prerequisite work)

**Gap Status values**: `covered` (task exists), `gap` (no task — requires justification in Notes, user confirmation required before plan approval)

## Implementation Phases

Select ONE phase structure based on implementation approach from Design Doc.
See documentation-criteria skill for detailed Phase Division Criteria.
All quality checks follow Quality Check Workflow from ai-development-guide skill.

### Option A: Vertical Slice Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Vertical Slice. Each phase = one value unit with verification.

### Phase 1: [Value Unit 1 Name] (Estimated commits: X)

**Purpose**: [First vertical slice — proves approach works]
**Verification**: [From Verification Strategy: early verification point]

#### Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implementation
- [ ] Task 2: Verification per Verification Strategy
- [ ] Quality check (staged)

#### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] Early verification point passed
- [ ] [Functional criteria]

### Phase 2: [Value Unit 2 Name] (Estimated commits: X)

**Purpose**: [Subsequent value unit]
**Verification**: [From Verification Strategy]

#### Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implementation
- [ ] Task 2: Verification per Verification Strategy
- [ ] Quality check

#### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] [Functional criteria]
- [ ] [Quality criteria]

### Option B: Horizontal Slice Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Horizontal Slice. Phases follow Foundation → Core → Integration → QA.

### Phase 1: [Foundation] (Estimated commits: X)

**Purpose**: Contract definitions, interfaces, test preparation

#### Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Specific work content
- [ ] Task 2: Specific work content
- [ ] Quality check (staged)
- [ ] Unit tests: All related tests pass

#### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] [Functional completion criteria]
- [ ] [Quality completion criteria]

### Phase 2: [Core Feature] (Estimated commits: X)

**Purpose**: Business logic, unit tests

#### Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Specific work content
- [ ] Task 2: Specific work content
- [ ] Quality check (staged)
- [ ] Integration tests: Verify overall feature functionality

#### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] [Functional completion criteria]
- [ ] [Quality completion criteria]

### Phase 3: [Integration] (Estimated commits: X)

**Purpose**: External connections, presentation layer

#### Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Specific work content
- [ ] Task 2: Specific work content
- [ ] Quality check
- [ ] Integration tests: Verify component coordination

#### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] [Functional completion criteria]
- [ ] [Quality completion criteria]

### Option C: Hybrid Phase Structure

Use when implementation approach is Hybrid. Combine vertical and horizontal phases as defined in Design Doc implementation approach. Structure phases per Design Doc specification, ensuring each phase has Tasks, Verification, and Phase Completion Criteria sections matching the format above.

### Final Phase: Quality Assurance (Required) (Estimated commits: 1)

This phase is required for ALL implementation approaches.

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting quality assurance and Design Doc consistency verification

#### Tasks

- [ ] Verify all Design Doc acceptance criteria achieved
- [ ] Security review: Verify security considerations from Design Doc are implemented
- [ ] Quality checks (types, lint, format)
- [ ] Execute all tests (including integration/E2E from test skeletons, when provided)
- [ ] Coverage 70%+
- [ ] Document updates

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Quality check (staged)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Static check pass
- [ ] Lint check pass
- [ ] Build success

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] All integration/E2E tests passing (when test skeletons provided)
- [ ] Design Doc acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Staged quality checks completed (zero errors)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Necessary documentation updated
- [ ] User review approval obtained
